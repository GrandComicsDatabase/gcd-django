This is the implementation of the Grand Comics Database in Python
using the Django framework.

For basic information, see the README file in the project's root directory.

The specifics of setting up a development environment on MacOS X or Linux is
documented in the file
Getting_Started_on_MacOS_or_Linux.txt
The specifics of setting up a development environment on Windows is
documented in the file
Getting_Started_on_Windows.txt
or
Getting_Started_on_Windows_x64.txt

After you went through the steps return to here and follow the instruction to
use a current dump of our database in the dev-environment.

===============================================================================
= The GCD project and apps
===============================================================================

settings.py and settings_local.py
=================================
In the top level directory of your repository clone, open up settings.py and
take a look at it.  You should create a settings_local.py file in the same
directory, and override any values from settings.py that need overriding in
that settings_local.py.  Do not modify settings.py itself, unless you need
to push a change out to all other development and production environments.

Our .gitignore settings will prevent git from noticing settings_local.py.

The settings.py file has numerous comments indicating what needs to be overridden.
The most obvious are the DATABASES and CACHES group of settings.

By default, we assume that the database is called 'gcdonline'. It can be
accessed by a user called 'gcdonline' with no password. If you set your
database up differently, look for settings that start with DATABASE. Override
them appropriately.

Creating your test database
===========================
Create your database and set up whatever permissions you want.  Django
will create the tables for you, but you need to create the database first.

E.g. from MySQL command line client do:
create schema gcdonline;
create user gcdonline;
grant all on gcdonline.* to gcdonline;

Populating your database with empty tables
==========================================
From the root project directory, run

python manage.py syncdb

which will create the various tables that are not present in the data dump and
load data in tables that need them. DO NOT create a local admin user when
syncdb prompts you to do so.  Creating such a user will produce a user without
a profile (gcd_indexer row) which will cause problems.

You will notice that syncdb says that it cannot sync some apps because they
are controlled by South migrations.  To run the migrations, run:

python manage.py migrate

This will create the remainder of the tables, populate them with the required
initial data, and update your schema if any updates beyond the initial state
are required. See

http://south.aeracode.org/

for help with any difficulties with South.

Finally run 

python manage.py loaddata users

this will add an admin user, an approver, and a basic indexer. The usernames,
email addresses and passwords can be seen in the fixture file, which is
located at apps/gcd/fixtures/users.yaml.

Populating your database with the GCD data
==========================================
If you want data in your database, and know that the current development master
matches the production schema, you can load a data dump from

http://www.comics.org/download/

Contact the GCD tech team to find out if the development and production
schemas currently match, and what to do if they do not.

With the default user and database-name you need to do
mysql -ugcdonline gcdonline < dump.sql
(You might want to do -v to see something is happening)

Note that we do not distribute the images for covers and other user contributed
uploads of scans.

Run backend search facility
===========================
For haystack search to work one needs to run elasticsearch search backend.
The latest version can be downloaded here: http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/

Either use the provided deb/rpm or unpack it and run 'bin/elasticsearch -f' (on Linux and Mac) or 'bin\elasticsearch.bat' (on Windows).

If you get an error like "Unsupported major.minor version 51.0" and a stack
trace, it means that you need to update your java runtime.

After that you can run 'python manage.py rebuild_index' in gcd-django directory to populate your search indexes with data.

Launching your test web server
==============================
At this time you should be able to test your installation and data import using a
read-only mode, or try out editing with read-write mode.

Read-write mode is the default.
For read-only mode, set READ_ONLY = True and NO_OI = True in settings_local.py

Once your settings are chosen, run

python manage.py runserver

and take a look at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If you don't get any page at all, check http://www.djangoproject.com/ if it
looks like Django isn't configured correctly, or
http://dev.comics.org/ and/or http://groups.google.com/group/gcd-tech/
if it appears to be a code problem.

Proposing your first change for review
======================================
When you start making changes, go to the wiki at http://docs.comics.org/
for instructions on how to get code reviewed before checkin.  You'll need
to set up an account with our Review Board instance so that we can review
your first pull request before deciding whether to accept it.  If you develop
a good record of contributions, you will be granted direct access to the project.

Submissions to the project-owned repository that do not first go through
code review will be reverted without notice.
