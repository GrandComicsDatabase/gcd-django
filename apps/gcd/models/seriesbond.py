class SeriesRelativeBond(object):
    """
    Proxy for SeriesBond from the perspective of one of the series involved.

    SeriesBonds are directional, connecting an origin to a target.  However,
    when processing bonds in terms of a particular series, this means that
    the series in question is on the origin end of some bonds and the target
    end of others.  Often this is what you want.

    However, if you need to uniformaly process all bonds related to a series
    (or all bonds of a particular type or set of types related to a series),
    there's a lot of confusing work to do to keep track of which side of
    each *individual* bond you are on.  The main example of this is
    sorting all bonds based on their position within the series.

    This class takes a series and a bond and provides accessors relative
    to that series.  It is an error to instantiate this with a bond that
    does not connect to the given series.

    Since the main reason for this class is to deal with bonds within
    a series, and the primary differentiator is the issue, this
    class also defaults bond targets to the first issue and bond origins        
    to the last issue.  This can be overridden.
