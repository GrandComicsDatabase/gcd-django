<h2>How to Retrieve a Forgotten Password</h2>
<p>
We don't have an automated form for forgotten passwords yet.  However, you are welcome to <a href="mailto:contact@comics.org">email the GCD Contact list</a> and an admin can look up your account information for you.  We'll need some combination of your name and/or the username and email address set up for your account in order to locate you in our database.
