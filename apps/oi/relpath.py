    Represents a sequence of model attributes to access related fields/objects.

    Successivly applying each attribute to an instance will result in a
    related object.  i.e. applying ('series', 'publisher') to an issue
    will result in issue_instance.series.publisher, which is an instance
    of class Publisher.

    Successivly applying each attribute to a class with get_field will
    result in the field implementing the last step of the relation.
    i.e. applying ('series', 'publisher') to the class Issue will result
    in the Series.publisher ForeignKey object, an instance of Field.

    When applying an attribute for a many-to-many or one-to-many field
    to an instance, multiple values will be returned for each object
    in the many-to-many relation.  See apply_for_value for details.
