<h2>Welcome to the {{ site_name }}!</h2>

We're  a nonprofit, Internet-based organization of international volunteers

and we're glad you're here!  Give our search form a try, or take a look at the

<h3>New Features for January 2011!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since we now have a reasonable amount of data in our new ISBN field we have added it to our advanced search.
You can also link to a comic with an ISBN: http://www.comics.org/isbn/&lt;ISBN&gt;/.
</ul>
<h3>New Features for December 2010!</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Deletion support: All indexers may delete items from the database.
  <li> Wraparound and gatefold cover support: You can now upload and display
       wraparound and gatefold covers.
  <li> Newly uploaded landscape covers are shown larger in the full cover view.
  <li> Advanced search for covers: Searches for covers now show the cover images.
  <li> Multiple issue changes support: You can make changes to the issue information
       across multiple issues at the same time through Advanced Search results.
  <li> ISBN support: We've added a field to track ISBNs.
  <li> Improved sequence insertion: It's now easier to insert or reorder sequences
       anywhere in an issue.

  <li> Change history view: Detailed item change history since December 2009 is
       now visible. Pre-December 2009 change history (to the extent that it was
       recorded) will be imported in the near future.
  <li> Number of indexed issues per series: In all series lists we now display the 
       number of indexed issues to easily find series which need work.
