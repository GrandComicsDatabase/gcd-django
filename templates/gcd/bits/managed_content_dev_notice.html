<p>
This area normally features content managed by django-templatesadmin using
templates from the
<a href="https://github.com/GrandComicsDatabase/gcd-managed-content">gcd-managed-content</a>
repository, which should be checked out at <tt>templates/managed_content</tt>,
which is .gitignored in the main repository.
</p>
<p>
To test templatesadmin, check out the managed content repository and
set USE_TEMPLATESADMIN to True in your settings_local file.
