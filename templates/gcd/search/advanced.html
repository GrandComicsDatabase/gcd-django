<p>
This is another <strong>intermediate</strong> step towards a proper
advanced search form.  No work has yet been done to make the layout nice
or to make the input fields optimally sized.  The point of this step
was to produce a flexible base of code on which to build a more polished
search system.  The polish is forthcoming.  Some usage notes:
<ul>
  <li> All three methods of searching (contains, exact, regexp) are
       case-insensitive.  Regular expressions are powerful but not even
       remotely user-friendly.  The specific regexp syntax is
       <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html">MYSQL's</a>,
       which is POSIX-ish and relatively basic.
  <li> To search for "starts with" or "ends with", select Regular Expression
       and put '^' at the beginning or a '$' at the end respectively.  This
       will be made more user-friendly later.
  <li> The AND vs OR fields is an idea that didn't work out well.  It
       will be replaced shortly.  For now, it sort-of controls whether
       conditions are ANDed or ORed, but really only applies to most of
       the content fields a few others that made sense.
  <li> There's no way to specify an exclusion right now.
  <li> The imprint checkbox only affects searches for Publishers.  This
       needs to be made more clear (but it's usually what you want anyway).
  <li> Fields that apply to the issue but are stored in the Cover story
       record will be matched when specified in either the issue or story
       section.
  <li> Not selecting any country, language or indexer means you get all
       countries, languages and indexers.  Which is probably what most
       people would expect.
  <li> Search by indexer is only available at the series level as the tables
       that map issue indexes to indexers are not present in the public data.
  <li> If you try to order by something that doesn't make sense for the
       type of thing you're searching for (i.e. ordering Publishers by
       Penciler) it will just ignore you.  Obviously that doesn't count
       as a good usability decision.
